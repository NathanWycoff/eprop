Implement an SNN sim in tensorflow (done). This will allow us to:
1) Implement BPTT to optimize an SNN (done)
2) Implement Eprop2
3) Assess the "few shot" capabilities of eprop2: it works well for one-shot optim, but what if the machine has multiple "shots"? Does it eventually do worse than eprop1? Is there a "harmless" way to combine the two?
4)? Test for the effectiveness of a Hessian based optimization method, which could lead into a local Hessian-based optimization method, analogous to eprop1.
